# Daily-Weather-Dashboard
The dataset is in the form of Excel sheet.
The Sheet1 has question that are to  be work on using the Daily Weather dataset.
I have worked on this dataset in Microsoft Excel Sheet.
In this dataset I have created different sheets for each answer. The sheets are renamed as the question number except the one dashboard sheet.
In this dataset I have categorized the dataset based on condition in the year 2016.
The next is creating dashboard for which I have created 4 different sheets and merged the charts and graphs in the dashboard sheet.
